# cordova-plugin-android-webview-dark-mode

#### Apache Cordova plugin to enable dark mode support for Android WebView's

### Goals

In order for the Android WebView's to support dark modem we need to explicitly enable it.
This will allow the webview to properly use the `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` media query.

For that we need to use the `Configuration.UI_MODE_NIGHT_YES`, `WebSettingsCompat.setForceDark` and `WebSettingsCompat.setForceDarkStrategy` configurations.

### Supported platforms

-   **Android**

#### Prerequisites/Warnings

AndroidX is required. Therefore only **cordova-android >= 9.0.0** is supported.  
You need to enable AndroidX in your `config.xml` by setting `AndroidXEnabled` to `true`.

On your application you will need to add a metatag with the value `<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">`
